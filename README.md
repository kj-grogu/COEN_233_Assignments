# Communication between one client and one server: 
**1. Client using customized protocol on top of UDP protocol for sending information to the server.**
    Designed and implemented a custom protocol on top of UDP for client-server communication, handling packet structuring, acknowledgment, and error detection mechanisms, including sequence validation and payload integrity checks.
    Developed a robust error-handling module in python that manages out-of-sequence packets, length mismatches, and missing packet terminators, enhancing data transmission reliability.

**2. Client using customized protocol on top of UDP protocol for requesting identification from server for access permission to the cellular network.**
    Created a client application that requests access permission from a server for cellular network connectivity, utilizing a customized protocol to transmit subscriber information and technology preference.
    Programmed server-side validation of access requests against a verification database, accurately distinguishing subscriber payment status and granting or denying network access based on real-time data analysis.
